# advent-of-code

My solutions for advent of code.

## About

Advent of Code is a bunch of programming exercises that are quite fun to do. They mostly involve command line parsing and text processing.
They range from easy to medium in terms of difficulty. I have wanted to get into the habit of doing these for quite some time.


## Note

I am trying out Advent of Code in several languages. I will organize them by branches.

Here are the languages I hope to try these with:

1. Python
2. Nodejs
3. Haskell
4. Golang
5. Rust
6. OCAML
