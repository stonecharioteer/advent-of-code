Advent of Code is a bunch of programming exercises that are quite fun to do.
They mostly involve command line parsing and text processing.
They range from easy to medium in terms of difficulty.
I have wanted to get into the habit of doing these for quite some time.

.. note:: 

    I am trying out Advent of Code in several languages. I will organize them
    by branches.

    Here are the languages I hope to try these with:

    1. Python
    2. Rust
    3. Nodejs
    4. Haskell
    5. Golang
    6. OCAML
    7. Shell
    8. Racket

    In doing this I also want my approach to be similar.
    As in: ``aoc <year> <day> -f <file>` and `cat <file> | aoc <year> <day> -f -``

    should work irrespective of the language I use.
    I will solve all the previous year's problems in this way.
    Eventually, I may merge these and setup randomized testing for each.
